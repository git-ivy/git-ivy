# 🦋 Hello! I'm Nari

I enjoy learning, exploring, and contributing to the open source.  
Lately, I’ve been working with translations on **Weblate**, helping projects like **Fedora** become more accessible for Brazilian Portuguese speakers.
I also enjoy tweaking Linux, organizing my digital life, collecting games, and exploring open tools that make everything a little more creative and fun.

## 🌐 What I do on Weblate

I contribute by translating, reviewing, and adding context across several open source projects.  
My main focus right now:

- Translations for **Fedora Websites**
- Documentation and interface translations in the Fedora ecosystem
- Fixing inconsistencies and improving clarity in texts

## ✨ What Weblate is

Weblate is a collaborative translation platform that lets anyone translate software, websites, and documentation directly from the browser.  
It handles all the technical parts like Git integration, so contributions flow straight into official repositories without hassle.

## 💡 Why I contribute

- Access in your own language matters  
- Open source lives through its community  
- Learning through translation is fun  
- And contributing back to the projects I use feels good
