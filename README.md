# Hello! I'm Nari

I enjoy learning, exploring, and contributing to the open source.  
Lately, I’ve been working with translations on **Weblate**, helping projects like **Fedora** become more accessible for Brazilian Portuguese speakers.
I also enjoy tweaking Linux, organizing my digital life, collecting games, and exploring open tools that make everything a little more creative and fun.
